                Hi, my name is Richard Au. I was born and raised in Colorado. I first started coding as a hobby in 2014. While experiencing multiple profession throughout my college education, ultimately from my studies it lead me back to coding as the profession that I wanted to make a career out of. Being able to problem solve issues and to be able to see the results take effect is what made me pursue coding.
